# AirQualityAnalysis

Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to develop an Air Quality Analysis System that allows users to perform exploratory analysis on air quality data based on the existing database. By processing raw data from CSV files and organizing it into relevant data structures, the system offers users the ability to explore air quality metrics based on different criteria and time periods.
The input data will be organized into Date, Time, and AirQuality classes. Subsequently, using a customized implementation of a vector class, air quality data for each month will be encapsulated into a monthlyData class. This offers a higher level of granularity and promotes efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, a separate AirQualityAnalyzer class has been created to perform analysis based on user requests. This separation of implementation details from the main function enhances the modularity and maintainability of the system.

User Guide:
To utilize the Air Quality Analysis System, the user could follow the steps below:
1. Launch the program, and a text-based menu will be displayed, offering various options for data analysis.
2. Select an option from the menu to perform specific analysis tasks, such as viewing average temperature or relative humidity for a specific month or exploring data at a particular date and time.
3. Follow the prompts to input required information, such as month, date, or time.
4. Review the analysis results presented by the system to gain insights into air quality trends and patterns.
